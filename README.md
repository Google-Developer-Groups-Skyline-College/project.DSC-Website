## Setup & Guide

### **1.** **Install Node.Js**

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).<br>
From there, get a prebuilt Node.Js for your system.<br>
**Please make sure you are using Node.js version 22.14.0 (LTS).** This is the standardized version for this project, chosen for its stability and long-term support (LTS), which ensures reliability and compatibility throughout development.

Check if you have npm installed by running this on your command line:

```bash
npm - v
```

Although we are not using Node.Js for this project, we will still be using the package manager that comes with it, **npm**.

### **2.** **Cloning The Repository**

Clone this repository locally to your computer using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).<br>
Make a directory where you'll be working on the Data Science Club Website.<br>
Then, start by clicking the green <> Code button above, copying the URL, and putting the url inside:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Move to the repository directory by:

```bash
cd <repository_name>
```

### **3.** **Installing Dependencies**

Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

## Usage

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### **Making Changes And Committing Code**

If you make changes, follow these steps:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch  # Create a new branch
git add .                       # Stage changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"  # Commit changes
